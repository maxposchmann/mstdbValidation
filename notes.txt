Systems with apparently no experimental data:

NaCl–UCl3: MSTDB paper references Benes and Konings (2008) "Thermodynamic evaluation of the NaCl–MgCl2–UCl3–PuCl3 system". For the NaCl–UCl3 system, it points to a report "Fast Reactors Using Molten Chloride Salts as Fuel" for the only datapoint, which is a eutectic transition. However, while this report does contain the cited value, there is no evidence that any experiments were completed to determine it.

LaF3–PuF3: MSTDB paper references Benes and Konings (2008) "Actinide burner fuel: Potential compositions based on the thermodynamic evaluation of MF–PuF3 (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) and LaF3–PuF3 systems". From this paper: "The other four binary phase diagrams (KF–PuF3, RbF–PuF3, CsF–PuF3 and LaF3–PuF3) presented in this study have been estimated based on the data from the proxy systems containing LaF3 [3,4]." References 3 and 4 are for LiF–NaF–RbF–LaF3 and MF–LaF3 (M=Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) systems.
